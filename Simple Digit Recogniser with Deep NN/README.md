# Simple Digit Recogniser with Deep NN
Using a Keras/TensorFlow neural network to classify digits from MNIST dataset. Using PReLU for activation and four Dense layers with 254 neurons each. Also a dropout is introduced between the activation and the Dense layers (with a value of 0.25). The system can reach 0.932 accuracy after 30 epoches.
